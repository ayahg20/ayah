      			You can modify the text of this index page (index.html) or delete it. This is an example to ensure
      			that the JCCC student account is set up correctly. You may edit this page any way you like through a text editor of your choice.
      		</p>
      		<p>
      			When you are satisfied with your edited page, you can upload it to the server within the public_html folder. Files and folders not located in the public_html folder will not be shown.

      			<i>
      				The public_html directory is the folder to place web-readable files. This means that the public_html folder is where you store all website/webcontent files which will appear when someone types in the websites URL name.  Anything you place in the public_html directory can be viewed by the web server.
      			</i>
      		</p>	
      		<p>
      			If you do not have an index.html page in the folder you can connect to a specific .html file name.
